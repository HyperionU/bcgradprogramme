## The BC Graduation Programme

> The B.C. Graduation Program ensures that students graduate from secondary school as educated citizens, with the knowledge, competencies, and skills they will need to transition successfully into higher education, training and the workforce.
The programme is what you're entering next year.

## The Three Year Rule

* Once you enter, the clock is ticking.
* You have three years (Grades 10, 11 & 12) to get your credits.
* If you fail, you're 'kicked' from the school, and will need to finish your classes (likely through Central).

## Credits (& Credited Courses)
